# ESP32-LED-Driver-Hub
This is my first time ever using c++, so the code will be pretty stupid from times to times.

Driving my WS2814 spotlights with ESP32. Can be easily refitted into other use cases!
Takes playing animations to another level, by allowing groups of lights (clusters) to be assigned their own animation and an easy API to change settings and speeds for the animations.

Description comming soon... (It's annoying to write descritions..)

Built using PlatformIO.
